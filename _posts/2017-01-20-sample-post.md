title: My Thoughts so Far on Season 7
---

I've been a loyal viewer of TWD since the very first episode. To be honest, I never though the show would go on this long. Yet, now that we are at Season 7, it seems like there might be an end coming in the next season. As I reflect on this season, I really can't see what else the Alexandria group could come upon next. They've fought off waves of zombies, battled with other survivors, and have searched for a new home several times now. It's kind of like a repeated cycle. I guess I'll use this post just think out loud about some of the things that bother me  about the current season.
