title: My Thoughts so Far on Season 7
---

I've been a loyal viewer of TWD since the very first episode. To be honest, I never though the show would go on this long. Yet, now that we are at Season 7, it seems like there might be an end coming in the next season. As I reflect on this season, I really can't see what else the Alexandria group could come upon next. They've fought off waves of zombies, battled with other survivors, and have searched for a new home several times now. It's kind of like a repeated cycle. I guess I'll use this post just think out loud about some of the things that bother me  about the current season. 

## Negan and Rick
These two characters are constantly interacting with Negan always getting the upper hand. It seems weird that Rick was a savage for so long, now only to be tamed by Negan's threat and of course the brutal killing of Glenn and Abe. We've seen Rick fight back against similar threats before, but with Negan he seems to be really subdued. It almost seems forced from a writing perspective as we approach the midseason and Rick is still playing Negan's game without any fight.
